# Python_bootcamp
 A short bootcamp for learning Python basics. We will use the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

## Running the notebook
You can see a few ways to run the notebook: if you click on it, there is a button to open in Google colab (an online Jupyter notebook service). We can also install Anaconda on our computer and use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab through the Anaconda Navigator or through a terminal or anaconda console or powershell by typing 'jupyter notebook'.

## Installing packages
Anaconda comes with a package installer, conda, and also pip. We can install most packages with conda like `conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn`, but we can also install them with pip if conda isn't working: `pip install scikit-learn`.
